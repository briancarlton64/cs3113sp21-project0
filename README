This program will take in a list of programs, their burst time and priorties, and returns a list of statistics regarding the list of programs.
There are seven stats listed:

voluntary context switches: the amount of times that the program encounters a new process that has not been encountered before

non-voluntary context switches: the amount of times that the program encounters processes that have already been encountered

CPU Utilization: the amount of time that the CPU is busy, in this case, always 100 percent of the time.

Throughput: the amount of work done per unit time

Turnaround time: the amount of time taken from task submission to completetion

Waiting time: the amount of time from the submission of a process to the beginning of the last time a process is started

Response time: the amount of time from the submission of a process to the beginning of the first time a process is started

All methods within this program are for the express purpose of calculating these statistics.
